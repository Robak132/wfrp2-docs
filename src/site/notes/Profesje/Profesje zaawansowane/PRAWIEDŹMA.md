*Profesja zaawansowana (Realm of the Ice Queen s. 101)*

The legendary hag mothers are very powerful hag witches, known for their powers of divination, healing, and their influence over the Ancient Widow’s spirits. Most eke out simple lives in rustic huts far from the communities they watch over. These hag mothers rarely leave their haunted homes, forcing those seeking their aid to undertake arduous journeys to reach them. However, a few hag mothers do wander Kislev, following wherever the spirits lead them and sharing their knowledge. Although most appear impossibly old and bent—their twisted spines creaking alarmingly at the smallest movement—many retain their youthful vigour and can be unexpectedly spry.

**Wyposażenie:** Like other hags, hag mothers are talented healers, and they are never without the accoutrements of the trade. A hag mother usually carries an antitoxin kit, an apothecary kit, and at least three healing draughts and healing poultices. Most also have three or more potions (RoS, page 192). To ward away the chill that infiltrates everything, they also are never far from a skin of koumiss. Hag mothers wear the distinctive shawl and often carry walking sticks.
